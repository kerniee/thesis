# FAQ
There is a full *LaTeX* template for your annotation work.
It can be imported to Overleaf or used offline.
Please start with **replacing the stub title to the real one**.

## How to replace the title page with the real one
1. Open `docx` [annotation title template](https://tfs.university.innopolis.ru/tfs/Edu/_git/doe-docs?path=%2Fannotation_title_template&version=GBmaster&_a=contents) and choose appropriate track or specialty (BS - Bachelor, MS - Master).
2. Enter **thesis title** and **your name** (Surname, Name, Patronymic (if any)) in appropriate places in Russian language.
3. Convert it to `title.pdf` and replace it with the existing one in the root folder.
