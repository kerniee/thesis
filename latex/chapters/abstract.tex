The rapid development of software has increased security challenges and vulnerabilities, posing significant risks. Despite efforts, cyber threats persist, and no foolproof method ensures software correctness.

This thesis investigates Metamorphic Testing and Combinatorial Testing to improve cybersecurity. The research evaluates their combined effectiveness in detecting security flaws.

A rigorous study applied these testing methods to various software systems, using black-box techniques like Domain Testing, Boundary Value Analysis, and Metamorphic Relations. Extensive experimentation assessed their benefits and limitations.

Findings show that integrating these testing techniques significantly improves software security testing. This approach offers superior vulnerability coverage and a better understanding of software behavior.

The research provides a practical framework for enhancing cybersecurity, applicable in both industry and academia. It advances cybersecurity and offers insights into protecting software systems in an interconnected world.
