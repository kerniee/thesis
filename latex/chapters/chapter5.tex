\chapter{Results}
\label{ch:results}

This chapter presents the outcomes of test executions and compare it to the original Java COMER framework implementation. 

\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:evaluation}

To evaluate the efficacy of my implementation of the COMER framework, I conducted a series of experiments comparing its performance with the original Java implementation by Niu \textit{et al.} \cite{comer}.
The experiments focused on assessing the framework's ability to generate test cases accurately and efficiently across various scenarios.
